### 08. Reflection

The biggest challenge in developing FootballStatApp was adapting to spatial computing, which required completely rethinking how users interact with data. Unlike traditional 2D apps, designing for 3D space meant considering depth, positioning, and how football statistics would look floating in mixed reality. Since visionOS is Apple's newest platform, there were limited tutorials, community resources, and best practices available, forcing me to learn through trial and error. Testing was also difficult without consistent access to physical Apple Vision Pro hardware, relying mostly on the simulator which couldn't fully replicate real spatial interactions.

This project taught me that spatial computing isn't just about adding 3D elements to existing apps ‚Äì it requires fundamentally different thinking about user experience and interface design. I learned the importance of modular architecture when working with emerging technologies, as it made the app more maintainable and easier to debug. Performance optimization became even more critical in spatial computing, since any lag or visual inconsistencies immediately break the immersive experience that makes these apps compelling.

Working with visionOS also showed me the transformative potential of spatial computing for data visualization. While challenging due to limited resources and documentation, this project positioned me at the forefront of an emerging technology that will likely become mainstream. The experience reinforced the value of experimenting with new platforms early, even when the learning curve is steep, as it provides insights into the future direction of user interface design.
